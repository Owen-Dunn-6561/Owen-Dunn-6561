# Greetings

I'm a senior undergraduate student at the University of North Florida who is pursuing a Bachelor's of Science in Mathematics. I enjoy learning about many kinds of subjects, but I am most interested in **Mathematics**, **Computer Science**, and **Statistics**, and the subjects that result from their overlap. 

## My Projects

Here are the most recent projects I've worked on.

### Dilworth's Theorem Presentation
This project was for the UNF Osprey Math Conference. I discussed Partial Orders, Dilworth's Theorem, and the Application of these concepts.


### Guess The Manga Game
This is a script I wrote in python to gather data which is used to create a game where one does what is said on the tin.
+ Created in **Python**
+ Uses **BeautifulSoup** and **HTML parsing** to collect data
+ Uses **Tkinter** to create a **GUI** for easier use
